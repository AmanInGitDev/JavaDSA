1. Reverse a String II - There are three ways for now doing this;
    I) RevString_I - We can simply use a character array as input and by two pointers solve it
    II) RevString_II = We have to use Vector<> for character and Arrays for a list;
    III) RevString_III - We have to use Stack collection but it uses O(n) rather all above uses O(1) space;

2. Palindrome Check
    I) There will be the same method as Reversing, but here we compare rather that setting, optimal is when we use two pointers
